    abstract = { In the last chapter we discussed why grid points must cluster at boundaries for spectral methods based on polynomials. In particular, we introduced the Chebyshev points, xj =cos (jπ/N), j=0,1,… ,N, 6.1 which cluster as required. In this chapter we shall use these points to construct Chebyshev differentiation matrices and apply these matrices to differentiate a few functions. The same set of points will continue to be the basis of many of our computations throughout the rest of the book. Our scheme is as follows. Given a grid function v defined on the Chebyshev points, we obtain a discrete derivative w in two steps: • Let p be the unique polynomial of degree ≤ N with p ( xj )= υj , 0≤j≤N . • Set wj = p′ ( xj ) . This operation is linear, so it can be represented by multiplication by an (N+1)× (N+1) matrix, which we shall denote by DN : w= DN υ. Here N is an arbitrary positive integer, even or odd. The restriction to even N in this book (p. 18) applies to Fourier, not Chebyshev spectral methods. To get a feel for the interpolation process, we take a look at N=1 and N=2 before proceeding to the general case. }
